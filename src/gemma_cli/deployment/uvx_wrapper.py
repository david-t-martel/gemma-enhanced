# src/gemma_cli/deployment/uvx_wrapper.py

"""
Placeholder for uvx binary wrapper for gemma.exe.

This module would contain logic to:
1. Locate the gemma.exe executable (potentially bundled).
2. Set up the necessary environment variables or paths.
3. Execute gemma.exe with the provided arguments.
4. Handle stdout/stderr and potentially stream output back to the Python CLI.

This would abstract away the direct subprocess call in core/gemma.py
and provide a more robust, deployable solution for running the C++ backend.
